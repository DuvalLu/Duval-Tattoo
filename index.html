          Angel Hernandez Artist I was born in Cuba, I have always liked arts
          and crafts and painting a lot, which led me to the art of tattooing.
          Motivated by my friends and family I started tattooing in Miami. I
          prefer several styles, watercolor, letters, geometric, full black,
          Japanese, sketching, trash polka. It’s my favorite to combine several
          styles as well as the black and grey with color details.
